MARTINI GLASS SCREENING TEST
== please view in a monospace text editor ==

As part of our candidate selection process, we ask candidates to take this small preliminary tech test. The test involves 
implementing a small console program according to the specifications given below.

You may write your solution in any of the following languages:

Javascript. Solution will be executed with node.js v18, with the command-line “node martini.js <arg>”. If implementing in 
TypeScript, please include your source .ts file as well.

Python. Solution will be executed with Python 3.11 with the command-line “python martini.py <arg>”

C#. Solution will be compiled with the csc compiler distributed with VS2022 via the command-line “csc martini.cs”, and run 
via “martini.exe <arg>”. 

C++. Solution will be compiled with the cl compiler distributed with VS2022 via the command-line “cl /std:c++17 /EHsc martini.cpp”, 
and run via “martini.exe <arg>”. 

This test does not have a time constraint, and is expected to take roughly 30 minutes to a little over an hour to complete. This 
is a screening test. Accepted candidates will receive an interview, followed by a more substantial tech test. 


The Tech Test:
As for the test itself, we would like for you to create a martini glass in ASCII form. The height and width of this glass should 
be customizable based on input from a user. You don't need to have a GUI for this solution; a console input and output is just 
fine.

How it works:
A user will input a number describing the width of the top of the martini glass and a full martini glass should be created.
Program Specifications:
* The program should take a single integer argument, representing the width of the top of the glass, designated ‘n’. 
* The bowl of glass should be composed of ‘%’ characters. It should be ‘n’ characters wide at the top, and 1 character wide at 
  the bottom. Each row should be filled with ‘%’ characters
* The bowl of the martini glass should narrow by 2 characters with every row, unless there are exactly 2 characters in the preceding 
  row. In that case the next row should have 1 character. 
* The martini glass should be left-biased. If an even number is submitted, the stem should  be drawn on column (n / 2)-1, e.g 
  if n=4, it would draw on the 2nd column. 
* The stem of the glass should be drawn of ‘|’ (pipe) characters, be 1 character wide, and ‘n’ characters in height. 
* The base of the glass should be composed of ‘=’ characters, be ‘n’ characters wide, and 1 character tall. 
* The program should error if given no argument, or an argument that is not a number.
* The program should output nothing if given an invalid numeric argument

Examples:

If a user inputs the value 5 the Martini Glass should look like the following:
%%%%%
 %%%
  %
  |
  |
  |
  |
  |
=====

If a user inputs the value of 2 the Martini Glass should look like the following:
%%
%
|
|
==

As you can see the look of it will seem odd, but should still attempt to create one.

Submissions:
To submit your test, please email your solution source file as an attachment to submissions@stormflaggames.com. You must add a 
suffix to your filename or it will likely be rejected, for example: martini.js.txt. If your steps to build and run your program 
differ from the previously mentioned steps, it’s important to include a quick how-to on steps to compile and run your program.
Also do not send any .exe files or executables directly to us for your submission.  This is partly because Stormflag may not 
receive the submission due to being flagged as potentially malicious, and for our security will not open or run anything sent 
this way. 

Best of luck!
